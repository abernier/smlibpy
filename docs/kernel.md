# The kernel

smlibpy is a Python layer over **SMLib**, a NURBS boundary-representation solid modeling
kernel with a long industrial history. NVIDIA released it, together with a C-style API and
Python bindings, as open source under the Apache License 2.0 in the
[usd-brep](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/usd-brep) repository.

## How it fits together

```text
smlibpy (Python)         shapes, selections, sketches, features, STEP/glTF/STL, viewer
  └─ smlibpy._core       one compiled extension module
       ├─ ext            smlibpy's own C++: exact geometry and topology access, transforms,
       │                 sweeps with all options, error-controlled integration of mass
       │                 properties and curve lengths, body splitting
       ├─ SmPyLib        NVIDIA's pybind11 bindings of SM_API (without the USD parts)
       ├─ SM_API         NVIDIA's C-style API over the kernel
       └─ SMLib          the kernel: geometry, topology, Booleans, fillets, sweeps, healing
```

The kernel sources come in as a git submodule (`third_party/usd-brep`) and are compiled
with CMake into a single, self-contained Python extension. Nothing of the kernel is
modified; where smlibpy needs more than the published bindings offer, its own C++ code
(`src/cpp/`) calls the kernel directly.

## Accuracy

- **Geometry** is exact: planes, cylinders, cones, spheres and tori are analytic; free-form
  geometry is NURBS. Booleans and fillets work on the exact surfaces.
- **Areas, volumes, centers and inertia** are integrated over the exact geometry to seven
  significant digits by default (`ACCURACY = 1e-7`; see [Measuring](analysis.md)), with an
  error estimate for each of them. The integration is smlibpy's own
  (`src/cpp/measure.cpp`): the kernel's (`SmBrep::ComputePreciseProperties`) controls its
  steps by the area alone and measures them against the running sum along each trim curve,
  so its volumes and moments can be far worse than asked for (the swept spring of
  `examples/spring.py`: 2.9e-5 at 1e-7, still 2.8e-7 at 1e-9 after 12 s). smlibpy integrates
  the same surface integrals over the faces' trim curves (Green's theorem in the parameter
  plane) with adaptive Gauss–Kronrod quadrature, split at the knots, until every estimate is
  ten times below the accuracy asked for. It is also faster: the spring takes 0.47 s instead
  of 1.1 s, most parts a few milliseconds. The quick checks inside operations (is a result
  inside out, did a fillet change the volume plausibly) still use the kernel's integration at
  a coarse accuracy.
- **Edge lengths** are integrated per knot span to 1e-12 (the kernel's `SmCurve::Length`
  counts a span whose curve starts with a zero tangent as 0).
- **A body is as exact as its faces meet.** Faces that the kernel fits (B-spline chamfers,
  shell offsets, intersections of curved faces) close up only to about 1e-6 to 2e-5 mm; the
  volume of such a body depends on that by 1e-7 to 4e-6 of its value.
- **STEP export** writes the kernel's exact curves and surfaces. The test suite reads the
  files back with OpenCASCADE and checks validity and volume.
- **STEP import** rebuilds every face on its exact surface and keeps the file's topology,
  so faces share edges instead of being stitched by tolerance.

## Robustness work in smlibpy

Some kernel behaviour is wrapped so that it is predictable:

| Kernel behaviour | What smlibpy does |
|---|---|
| Plane cuts keep the other half than documented and leave the body open | `split` intersects with a half space instead |
| 2D Booleans reject some overlaps (two circles, for one) | falls back to 3D Booleans of thin slabs |
| Fillets larger than the geometry allows can come back as a "valid" solid | checks the radius against neighbouring edges and the volume change |
| Sweeps anchor the profile at the start point of its first curve | centers the profile on the path and orients it |
| A full 360 degree non-manifold revolve returns an empty body | revolves each loop and subtracts the holes |
| Faces on cylinders, cones, spheres and tori need a seam edge, but NX and others write them without one | adds the seam along the surface when importing STEP |
| The seam has to lie where the surface's angle parameter starts | turns the surface frame to the seam edge of the file |
| The extended offset mode depends on memory layout and sometimes builds a face the kernel cannot integrate or mesh | `shell` uses the plain mode first, checks every result and falls back to the extended mode |
| Arcs from the API are plain B-splines | arcs are trimmed kernel circles, so they keep radius and center |
| Mass properties control their integration steps by the area alone: a volume can be 300 times worse than the accuracy asked for | integrates areas, volumes, centers and inertia itself, with an error estimate for each |
| A curve's length leaves out a span that starts with a zero tangent (the outline of a cylinder had 30 mm top and bottom lines instead of 60) | integrates lengths and arc-length positions itself |
| Tessellation cuts each face into a grid placed by the curves along its borders, so a face that is straight in one direction and twisted along it gets one facet across (a twisted bar: 1 mm off) | estimates for every face how far the grid would be off and halves all faces of such a body until they are flat; other bodies keep the kernel's triangles |

## Known kernel limitations

From usd-brep's own list of known issues, the ones that can matter here:

- `heal` may report success without repairing everything; check `is_valid()` afterwards.
- Healing of imported periodic faces (tori, spheres) can go wrong.
- Rounds where three fillets meet at a corner of mixed convexity can fail; round the
  edges in a different order or with different radii.
- `shell` cannot remove a face that is bordered by fillets; shell first, then round the rim.
- `offset` can take a few attempts on complex parts, each as long as the operation itself.

## Building the kernel

The build compiles about 250 C++ files and takes a minute or two. It is single threaded
inside the kernel unless oneTBB is available (`-DSMLIBPY_USE_TBB=ON`, used for parallel
tessellation and Boolean preprocessing).
